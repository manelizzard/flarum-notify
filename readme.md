# flarum-slack

Simple notifications for Flarum. Get notified about forum activities via Slack, HipChat or Gitter.

## WORK IN PROGRESS!

As flarum is moving quickly and the team still changes a lot of things, this plugin may change and not be stable from time to time.

### Actually working for Flarum Beta 6 and Slack

## Setup

Setup is quite simple. As there is no installer for flarum extensions yet, you will have to download the latest release. Just download the contained 'flarum-notify.zip', extract it and add the folder `notify`, which will be extracted from the archive, to your flarum extensions folder.

## Usage

After having uploaded the folder, go to the extensions panel and enable "Notify". In order to make the extension work properly, you will need to provide credentials for the service you want to use. Read about how to get those in the settings panels.

The rest should be self-explaining. :-)
